# 🌷 Hi, I’m **Keerthana K**

I’m an **AI/ML Developer** with 2+ years of experience building backend systems and delivering AI features in production environments.

I build backend systems that bring **applied AI** into real products. From designing scalable architectures to developing intelligent services, my focus is on building reliable systems that translate ideas into working solutions. I’ve worked with *generative AI*, *agent-based workflows*, and *vision-driven applications* deployed in production.

I’m also exploring modern frontend development to better understand the full lifecycle of building and shipping software.

## 👩‍💻 What I Do

- Backend system design and development  
- Microservices architecture and REST API development  
- Generative AI and agent-based systems  
- Applied computer vision solutions  
- Writing clean, maintainable, production-ready code  

## 🛠 Skills & Tools

### Engineering  
`Python`  `JavaScript`  `TypeScript`  `Node.js`  `Express`  
`REST APIs`  `Microservices`  `React`  `Next.js`
