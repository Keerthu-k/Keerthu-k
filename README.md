# 👋 Hi, I’m Keerthana K

I’m an AI/ML Developer with 2+ years of experience building backend systems and delivering practical AI features in production environments. I enjoy solving real product problems and turning ideas into reliable, scalable solutions.

Generative AI has been a core part of my work, including agent-based systems and vision-driven applications designed for real-world use. My focus sits at the intersection of backend engineering and applied AI, where strong architecture and clean implementation matter just as much as model performance.

I’m also exploring modern frontend development to better understand the complete lifecycle of building and shipping software.

* Backend system design and development
* Microservices and REST API development
* Generative AI and agent-based systems
* Applied computer vision solutions
* Clean, maintainable, production-focused code
